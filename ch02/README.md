# Backend

There is a client(mobile, PCs) that sends request to a server(Express in our case) which will be always listening for requests from different routes, process requests and send back appropriate responses.

"/" is usually the home route

### Different Types of request

- GET - request for specific data
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE
